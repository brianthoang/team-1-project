      <p class="description">Pokémon (which is an abbreviation for "Pocket Monsters") is a Japanese franchise ran by Nintendo that orginally started out as a game where game players would take the role of Pokémon trainers and collect different Pokémon characters and use them to battle other Pokémons. Pokémon was created by a man named Satoshi Tajiri and is illustator friend, Ken Sugimori. When Satoshi Tajiri started to make his own video games, he was influenced by his childhood passion of exploring the forests and finding different bugs and tadpoles, which ultimately made him pitch this idea to Nintendo. Fast forward to today, Pokémon is one of the most successful and well-known video game franchises in the world.
      </p>

      <p class="description">From the start, Pokémon is a role-playing game where Pokémon characters would be used to battle other Pokémon characters in order to be the best Pokémon trainer. Pokémons can be separated into multiple catagories such as generation and types (like fire and water). Every time a Pokémon is used, the Pokémon gets stronger and gains new abilities. Pokémon games were first released for the Game Boy. Then, games were released for the Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance. As the Game Boys started to discontinue, Pokémon games were then released for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS. Now, Pokémon games are being moved to the Nintendo Switch. However, in 2016, Pokémon GO was created and played through mobile devices. Pokémon GO became hugely successful because it used the devices' camera and created an augmented reality game where Pokémon GO users can capture different Pokémons in their real-life world locations.
      </p>
    
      <p class="description">Since the success of Pokémon games, the Pokémon franchise started to expand into different forms of media entertainment. For example, Pokémon has gone into television through anime series and movies. To this day, Pokémon (the TV series) has 25 seasons with the first season airing in 1997. This anime series follows the journey of the main character, Ash Ketchum, and his friends while they travel the world exploring different Pokémons. In addition to the anime series, Pokémon has also made several films with the first film debuting in 1998 and 1999 in Japan and North America, respectively. Just recently, a live-action film was made in 2019 called "Pokémon Detective Pikachu", that starred Ryan Reynolds. Not only is Pokémon made into a video game, but Pokémon can also be played through physical cards. The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) is a card game where users collect different types and kinds of Pokémon cards and battle their opponents.
